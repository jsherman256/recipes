# Cheesy Baked Pasta With Sausage and Ricotta

Adapted from [NY Times Cooking](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020811-cheesy-baked-pasta-with-sausage-and-ricotta). Serves 6

## Ingredients
### For the sausage
* 1lb ground pork
* 1 Tbs Penzey's Italian Sausage seasoning
* 1/4 tsp [Smoke n Sanity low FODMAP garlic salt](https://www.snsspices.com/product-page/Essence-of-Garlic-Salt-4oz-Shaker)

### For the pasta
* 12 oz shells, macaroni, or penne
* 250 mL (1 cup) water
* 1 jar of Rao's Sensitive Formula Marinara Sauce

### Cheese-wise
* 6 oz ricotta
* Parmesean, to taste

## Directions
1. Preheat the oven to 425Â° F
2. Mix all sausage ingredients together in a bowl
3. Heat an empty, oven-safe 12+" skillet to medium on the stove top
4. Once the skillet is heated, add the seasoned pork in a flat layer. Allow to brown a bit before stirring and breaking up chunks. Cook, stirring occasionally, until sausage is cooked through
5. Stir in the marinara sauce, pasta and water, and bring the mixture to a gentle simmer for about 2 minutes. Stir frequently to prevent the pasta from sticking
8. Add ricotta and parmesean on top and move to the oven
9. Cook for 15-22 minutes, or until pasta is cooked and the parmesean is at the desired level of meltiness

## Notes

* Ground pork contains enough fat to cook in the skillet without any added oil. If you substitute a leaner meat (ground chicken, turkey, etc), you may want to add some olive or canola oil
* The recipe was modified to contain no capcasin. If you can handle capcasin, consider adding red pepper flakes to the sausage mixture of even just prior to serving
* This recipe can be made low FODMAP by using low FODMAP pasta
* If more than 1/4th of the batch is eaten at once, the levels of lactose from the ricotta may be too high for those on the low FODMAP diet or who are lactose intolerant
* If you have shredded mozzarella, consider adding stirring some in or adding some on top prior to putting the skillet in the oven. Mozzarella is low in lactose and generally well-tolerated
