> I prefer to cook [mise en place](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mise_en_place), which is a cooking method that involves preparing all ingredients before doing any actual cooking. I highly recommend this method and have written the directions with this in mind

### Ingredients
* 1 pound shrimp, shelled
* 4 Tbsp butter
* 2 Tbsp garlic-infused olive oil
* 2 Tbsp olive oil
* 1/2 cup grated or shredded parmesan cheese
* 1/4 cup panko breadcrumbs
* 1/4 cup lemon juice
* 1/2 tsp ground black pepper
* 1/4 tsp oregano
* Cooked rice pasta (optional)

### Equipment
* Skillet
* 1 quarter-sheet baking pan or roasting pan
* Parchment paper


### Directions
1. Preheat oven to 425Â°F
1. Measure the breadcrumbs onto a parchment paper-lined sheet pan and toast in the oven for 1-2 minutes. They should be a deep brown color

1. Set oven to broil
1. Mix lemon juice, oregano and black pepper together in a measuring cup or similar vessel
1. Measure out parmesan cheese
1. Wait for oven to reach broil
1. Add butter, garlic-infused olive oil and regular olive oil to the skillet and place on medium-low heat
1. Once butter and oils are heated, add shrimp, lemon juice, oregano and black pepper. Stir gently and flip as needed
1. Once the shrimp is cooked, pour contents of skillet onto baking pan/roasting pan
1. Top shrimp with toasted panko breadcrumbs and parmesan cheese
1. Place under broiler until the cheese is melted and the breadcrumbs are crispy
1. Serve immediately. If serving with rice pasta, add the lemon butter pan sauce to the pasta for extra flavor
