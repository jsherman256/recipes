## Sous Vide Chicken Fajita

Serves 3  

### Ingredients
#### Spice mixture
* 1 Tbsp cumin
* 1/2 Tbsp dried oregano
* 1/2 Tbsp kosher salt
* 1/4 tsp ground black pepper
#### Marinade
* Half of spice mixture
* 1/2 Tbsp garlic olive oil
* 1/4 cup fresh cilantro, coarsely chopped

* ~1.5 lb chicken thighs or breasts, skinless and boneless
* 1-2 Tbsp canola oil
* ~1/4 cup flour
* ~1 Tbsp lime juice

### Directions
1. Heat sous vide circulator to 150Â°F
1. Make the spice mixture and split in half
1. Make the marinade, using half of the spice mixture
1. Toss the chicken in the marinade and place into the sous vide bag, along with any excess marinade
1. Cook the chicken/marinade mixture in the sous vide circulator for about 2 hours, ensuring the internal chicken temperature reaches 150
1. Keeping chicken and marinade in the bag, refrigerate for 1-2 hours
1. Remove chicken from sous vide bag and pat each piece down so they're mostly dry, removing any large chunks of marinade or cilantro. Set aside the extracted juices, gelatin and marinade
1. Mix the flour with the reserved spice mixture and toss each piece of chicken in it. Go for a light dusting, not a thick crust
1. Heat the oil in a skillet or large pot over medium-low heat
1. Sear the chicken in the oil until a nice brown is developed on each side and it's heated through, about 5 minutes total (Remember: it's already cooked!)
1. Use a paper towel to blot excess oil off the chicken pieces
1. Deglaze the pan with lime juice (and a bit of water if needed). Mix in the reserved gelatin, juices and marinade from the sous vide bag. Heat, stirring frequently, until thickened
1. Serve chicken topped with the pan sauce and topped with fresh cilantro if desired
